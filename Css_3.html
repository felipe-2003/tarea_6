                <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>

                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                    scrambled it
                    to make
                    a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting,
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including
                    versions
                    of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                    classical
                    Latin
                    literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                    Hampden-Sydney
                    College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                    passage, and
                    going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                    Lorem
                    Ipsum
                    comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
                    Evil) by
                    Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                    Renaissance.
                    The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                    Sections
                    1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
                    exact
                    original
                    form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

                <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>

                <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                    alteration
                    in some
                    form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
                    going to use
                    a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle
                    of
                    text.
                    All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making
                    this the
                    first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a
                    handful of
                    model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum
                    is
                    therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

                <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>

                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                    looking at
                    its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                    letters,
                    as
                    opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                    publishing
                    packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
                    'lorem
                    ipsum'
                    will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
                    sometimes by
                    accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
