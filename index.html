                <p class="container_parrafo_1"><b>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
                        industry. Lorem Ipsum has
                        been
                        the
                        industry's
                        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                        scrambled it
                        to make
                        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                        electronic
                        typesetting,
                        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                        Letraset
                        sheets
                        containing
                        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                        PageMaker
                        including
                        versions
                        of Lorem Ipsum.</b></p>

                <h2 class="container_titulo_2">Where does it come from?</h2>

                <p class="container_parrafo_2"><b>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
                        has roots in a piece of
                        classical
                        Latin
                        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
                        at
                        Hampden-Sydney
                        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                        Lorem
                        Ipsum
                        passage, and
                        going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
                        source.
                        Lorem
                        Ipsum
                        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of
                        Good
                        and
                        Evil) by
                        Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                        during
                        the
                        Renaissance.
                        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
                        1.10.32.

                        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
                        interested.
                        Sections
                        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in
                        their
                        exact
                        original
                        form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</b></p>

                <h2 class="container_titulo_3">Where can I get some?</h2>

                <p class="container_parrafo_3"><b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but
                        the majority have suffered
                        alteration
                        in some
                        form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If
                        you
                        are
                        going to use
                        a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in
                        the
                        middle
                        of
                        text.
                        All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
                        necessary,
                        making
                        this the
                        first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined
                        with a
                        handful of
                        model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated
                        Lorem
                        Ipsum
                        is
                        therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</b>
                </p>

                <h2 class="container_titulo_4">Why do we use it?</h2>

                <p class="container_parrafo_4"><b>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
                        readable content of a

                        when
                        looking at
                        its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                        of
                        letters,
                        as
                        opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many

                        publishing
                        packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
                        for
                        'lorem
                        ipsum'
                        will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
                        years,
                        sometimes by
                        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</b></p>
